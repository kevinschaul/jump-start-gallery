# jump-start-gallery

The gallery app for
[jump-start](https://github.com/kevinschaul/jump-start-template):
A shortcut to your favorite code.

If you want to use jump-start, you probably want to navigate to
[jump-start-template](https://github.com/kevinschaul/jump-start-template)
instead!

This repo contains two (very similar) galleries for your jump-start starters: A
static website, and a storybook. They are essentially equivalent, so you choose
which to set up!

## Installation

    npm install

## Develop the static website

    npm run dev

Open [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) in a browser.

## Develop the storybook website

    npm run storybook
